-- 2. What is the average price of all the Dogs and the average price of all the Cats.
SELECT a.species_id, s.current_name, s.price, COUNT(s.price) AS 'Count', COUNT(s.price) * s.price AS grand_total
FROM animals a
JOIN species s
	ON a.species_id = S.id
WHERE s.current_name = 'dog' OR s.current_name = 'cat'
GROUP BY s.id;




-- 3. Would it cost more to buy all the males or all the females animals based on their race price?
-- 	  (if the race price is null, or the animal doesn't have a race attached to it, use their specie's price)





-- 4. Show a sentence giving the price of the species, for each species ex: The Dogs cost: 200$...





-- 5. Show the cats with the letter "a" as the second letter in their name.
SELECT *, species.current_name
FROM animals 
JOIN species 
	ON animals.species_id = species.id
WHERE name LIKE '_a%' AND species.current_name = 'Cat'; -- also with substring


-- 6. Show the names of parrots by replacing "a" with "@" and "e" with "3".





-- 7. Show the dogs with an even number of letters in their names.






-- 8. Show the taxes you would pay on each animals and the total price. Assuming GST = 5% and HST = 9.9975% (Round to the tens)
